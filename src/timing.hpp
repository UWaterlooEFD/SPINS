/* The timing infrastructure works with a stack-based model.

   At portions of the code to be instrumented, call timing_push("name")
   with some (short but) memortable name for the code segment; after the
   end of the section call timing_pop().  This underlying code will build
   the corresponding call-time-tree and measure (via MPI_Wtime) the time
   between the timing_push and the corresponding timing_pop.

   This model does require that timing be called in a predictable way, such
   that timing_pop is called before any possible exit from the code path.*/
